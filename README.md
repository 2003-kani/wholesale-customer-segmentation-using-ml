Wholesale Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning
Project Overview
Wholesale customer label prediction is a machine learning (ML) technique used to predict the labels of new customers based on historical data. This project focuses on analyzing the spending behavior of wholesale customers and identifying opportunities for growth. The dataset consists of annual spending across various product categories such as fresh, milk, grocery, frozen, detergents, and paper, along with information on the customerâ€™s channel (hotel/restaurant/cafe or retail) and region (Lisbon, Oporto, or other).

By identifying customer segments with distinct spending behaviors, the project provides insights on how wholesale businesses can tailor marketing strategies and product offerings to better serve each customer segment.

Key Features:
Spending data across multiple categories
Channel of purchase (hotel/restaurant/cafe or retail)
Region of the customer (Lisbon, Oporto, or other)
Objective:
The goal is to use machine learning algorithms to segment wholesale customers based on their purchasing behavior, allowing businesses to:

Develop targeted marketing campaigns
Optimize inventory management
Improve customer satisfaction
Technologies Used
Python
Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy
Data Processing: Numpy, Scikit-learn preprocessing
